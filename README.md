# Description
The MNIST dataset provided in a easy-to-use CSV format
The original dataset is in a format that is difficult for beginners to use. This dataset uses the work of Joseph Redmon to provide the MNIST dataset in a CSV format.

The dataset consists of two files:

mnist_train.csv
mnist_test.csv
The mnist_train.csv file contains the 60,000 training examples and labels. The mnist_test.csv contains 10,000 test examples and labels. Each row consists of 785 values: the first value is the label (a number from 0 to 9) and the remaining 784 values are the pixel values (a number from 0 to 255).
